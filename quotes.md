> I finish off by buying books. It’s not too bad — $150. Since you can return books within a week and for most classes we don’t use the same book for too long, I consider saving money by returning the books and rebuying them each week until I don’t need them anymore.

> It turns out sign language is really a fascinating language, full of cruel puns (“pastuerized milk” is signed by moving the sign for milk past-your-eyes)

[Stanford: Day 5](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001423)

>I am not entirely sure what explains this. A large part of it is likely my writing in this space. I am frequently taking notes on my surroundings and thinking about how I will write about them. I suspect this gives me something of an ironic detachment that allows me to see the humor in my situation instead of feeling the pain. (For example, normally I’d feel anxious and glum about buying a file cabinet and leaving it outside because I’m too scared to ask for help. But now it’s simply a hilarious act in a drama! Whatever is going to happen to it?) It also gives otherwise meaningless events a purpose — I convince myself to talk to people and do things by saying that I will be able to write about them later.

---

>As for complaints about detachment, I am not actively trying to be detached. I want to meet people, but it is difficult. I try to make conversation, to get people to tell me about themselves, but I don’t really know what to ask. Most, I suspect, have had pretty normal lives — doing well in school, perhaps the usual outside interests. I cannot ask them about their hobbies or their jobs, because they do not have any. What, exactly, should I do?

>People seem to assume that I am like the high school freaks who sit under the bleachers and laugh with each other about the inanity of the good students. But my criticism comes not from detachment but experience — I have not thrown myself into cheers or into fountains, but I have tried my best to follow the acts and suggestions of others to the extent I can without compromising my sense of self (or clothing). One controvertial point was my discussion of dancing:

>>Inside the party, the clear focus was on the dancing. Teenagers moving their bodies in bizarre and vaguely rhythmic positions in close proximity to one another. I’d seen the practice frequently enough on TV, so on one level I knew what to expect, but on another it was wholly bizarre. It was like watching brownian motion or a complex screensaver, it’s completely meaningless and random but it’s also complicated enough that you don’t look away.

[Stanford: Day 4](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001422)

> This week we were repeatedly informed about the “unprecedented personal freedom” that we would have at Stanford. Apologies, but I don’t see it. First, I stay in a three-room system with four other people (two two-person bedrooms on either side and a shared office in the middle). Our only bathroom is down the hall, where there are five stalls shared with the whole hall. This means practically everything I do — sleeping, waking up, alarm clocks, working, showering, etc. — must be coordinated so as not to interfere with those other people. Stupid other people…

> Of course, this is not an accident. The whole thing is a giant privately-owned community, like some sort of Disney World. The run the government, the police, the restaurants, the bookstores, the shopping center, the transportation, the entertainment, etc. Worse yet, they track you while you use it all. Everyone gets an ID card which must be swiped to eat, visit the library, use a computer terminal, check your mail. It even has a RFID transmitter in it, so they can track us while we walk. (They didn’t bother to tell us this and we wouldn’t notice because it looks just like a regular card. I just found out because I happened to walk by a reader.) They register your computer’s MAC address so they can track you if you take your laptop anywhere.

> It’s like I’ve woken up in some sort of libertarian nightmare world, where one company has bought up everything and now tells everyone what to do. Obviously there’s no freedom, but the ardent libertarians still say “Look at how free you are! There’s no government telling you what to do!” If this is freedom, I think I might prefer tyranny.

>(As an aside, the small college by my house I went to had better food than this. It also was more like a university than this. I think Stanford's status has made it lazy.)

---

> Slightly tired of trying to meet new people like I'm told, I decide to sit alone at one table, in front of another empty table. I convince myself that I am not being anti-social but trying to attract the type of geniuses who are borderline autistic. The gambit doesn't work, everyone walks past me to sit at the empty table. Maybe no one at Stanford is borderline autistic.

[Stanford: Day 10 (Aaron Swartz: The Weblog)](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001427)


>I am running out of clothes, so I prepare to wash my clothes for the first time on my own. I learn how from Google, hoist my laundry nag and carry it to the stairs. A girl sees me pause and suggests I just drop the bag down the center of the stairwell. “At most you’d kill some freshman,” she adds encouragingly, before thinking to inquire if I’m a freshman.

>I carry my laundry down the old-fashioned way. The whole cleansing process takes two hours and has no visible effect on the clothes. I’d guess that the process removed microscopic germs, except for the fact that germs only thrive in damp, warm environments — exactly the environment created by the washing machine. It’s quite late and I don’t see an iron so I leave my clothes as they are for that hip, grungy look.



[My Life With Tim (Aaron Swartz's Raw Thought)](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/mylifewithtim)

>In 7th grade we were asked to do a project on the Great Men Who Made America, or something like that. Other kids chose civil rights leaders and politicians and even scientists. Then a big tech geek, I chose my hero, Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web.

---

>But a few, like “Do you have any regrets?” were not really answerable form such material. So, with some trepidation, I sent him an email. His website said not to email him about school projects on the Web, but I convined myself that school projects on him didn’t qualify. So I carefully composed my email and sent it out, hoping for the best.

>A few days later I received a rather short-tempered reply. “Regrets?” he said. “I have a few. But then again, too few to mention.” (I didn’t get the reference until years later when I heard the words again over the radio — I thought he was just being poetic.) But my favorite answer was his response to one of the theme questions I asked: “How do you think your work has shaped America?” or something like that. (I was taking the assignment a little too literally, I guess.) He shot back with a phrase that’s stuck with me ever since: “I was an Englishman living in France and working in Switzerland — it’s got nothing to do with America.” I proudly reported this back to my teacher, complaining about his assignment’s Amerocentrism.

> The next time I check Tim’s web page, it said not to email him concerning school projects on the Web or on Tim Berners-Lee.

> The last time my path crossed with TimBL is when I was applying for Stanford. My Dad happened to be in Cambridge at the time and insisted on asking TimBL for a letter of recommendation, by going over to TimBL’s office. Apparently he had better luck than I, since I’m told TimBL agreed and I was later accepted to Stanford. I guess a letter of recommendation from the creator of the Web counts for something, even if he is an Englishman.
