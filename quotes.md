[Stanford: Day 10 (Aaron Swartz: The Weblog)](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001427)


>I am running out of clothes, so I prepare to wash my clothes for the first time on my own. I learn how from Google, hoist my laundry nag and carry it to the stairs. A girl sees me pause and suggests I just drop the bag down the center of the stairwell. “At most you’d kill some freshman,” she adds encouragingly, before thinking to inquire if I’m a freshman.

[My Life With Tim (Aaron Swartz's Raw Thought)](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/mylifewithtim)

>In 7th grade we were asked to do a project on the Great Men Who Made America, or something like that. Other kids chose civil rights leaders and politicians and even scientists. Then a big tech geek, I chose my hero, Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web.

>But a few, like “Do you have any regrets?” were not really answerable form such material. So, with some trepidation, I sent him an email. His website said not to email him about school projects on the Web, but I convined myself that school projects on him didn’t qualify. So I carefully composed my email and sent it out, hoping for the best.

>A few days later I received a rather short-tempered reply. “Regrets?” he said. “I have a few. But then again, too few to mention.” (I didn’t get the reference until years later when I heard the words again over the radio — I thought he was just being poetic.) But my favorite answer was his response to one of the theme questions I asked: “How do you think your work has shaped America?” or something like that. (I was taking the assignment a little too literally, I guess.) He shot back with a phrase that’s stuck with me ever since: “I was an Englishman living in France and working in Switzerland — it’s got nothing to do with America.” I proudly reported this back to my teacher, complaining about his assignment’s Amerocentrism.

> The next time I check Tim’s web page, it said not to email him concerning school projects on the Web or on Tim Berners-Lee.
